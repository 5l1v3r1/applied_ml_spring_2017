**Room**: 428 Pupin Laboratories  
**Dates**: First class 1/18, last class 5/12

### Description
This class offers a hands-on approach to machine learning and data science. The
class discusses the application of machine learning methods like SVMs, Random
Forests, Gradient Boosting and neural networks on real world dataset, including
data preparation, model selection and evaluation. This class complements COMS
W4721 in that it relies entirely on available open source implementations in
scikit-learn and tensor flow for all implementations.  Apart from applying
models, we will also discuss software development tools and practices relevant
to productionizing machine learning models.


### Prerequisites
Familiarity with Python programming and basic use of NumPy, pandas and matplotlib.

### Grading / course grade
5 homework assignments (60%), midterm exam (20%), final in-class exam (20%).
All homework assignments are programming assignments and need to be submitted
via Github (as will be explained in the class). The midterm will test material
from the first half of the class, while the second exam will test material from
the second half.
