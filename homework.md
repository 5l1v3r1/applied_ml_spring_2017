## Homework policy
All homework assignments are due at 4pm of the day posted. No later
submissions (or commits) will be accepted. There are no deadline extensions.
The last commit before the deadline will be counted as your submission. All
homework assignments must execute on the Travis continuous integration server
to ensure reproducibility. All code is expected to run on Python 3.4 and adhere
to the pep8 standard as enforced by the pep8 (or flake8) linter. All functions
must contain numpy-style docstrings.  Please note that there is only one week
to work on homework 4.
